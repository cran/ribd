#' ribd: Computation of pedigree-based relatedness coefficients
#'
#' Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness coefficients,
#' including Jacquard's condensed identity coefficients. The standard algorithms
#' are extended to allow inbred founders. Both autosomal and X-linked
#' coeffiecients are computed.
