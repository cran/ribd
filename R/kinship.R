#' Kinship coefficients
#'
#' Compute the matrix of kinship coefficients (autosomal or X) of all members of
#' a pedigree. The founders may be inbred; see [pedtools::founderInbreeding()]
#' for how to set this up.
#'
#' For two (not necessarily distinct) members A, B of a pedigree, their
#' autosomal (resp. X) _kinship coefficient_ is defined as the probability that
#' random alleles sampled from A and B at the same autosomal (resp. X) locus,
#' are identical by descent relative to the pedigree.
#'
#' @param x A pedigree, in the form of a [`pedtools::ped`] object.
#'
#' @return A symmetric matrix containing all pairwise kinship coefficients in
#'   `x`.
#'
#' @seealso [inbreeding()], [kappa()]

#' @examples
#' # Kinship coefficients in a nuclear family with two children
#' x = nuclearPed(2)
#' kinship(x)
#'
#' # X chromosomal kinship coefficients in the same family
#' kinshipX(x)
